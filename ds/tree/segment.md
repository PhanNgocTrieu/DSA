# Segment Tree
## Definition:
*   a data structure that allows efficient querrying and updating of intervals or segments of an array
    *  The tree is built by dividing the array into segments until each represents a sigle element
    *   Enable fast query and update operations with a complexity of O(logn), making it powerful tool in algorithm design and optimization

*   Operations that segment tree can perform must be binary and associative.
    *   Finding range sum queries
    *   Searching index with given prefix sum
    *   Finding range maximum/minimum
    *   Counting frequency of Range Maximum/Minimum
